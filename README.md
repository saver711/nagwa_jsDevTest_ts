## üìù NOTES

### Missing info
* When i was working on this project, i needed to know targeted students age range. because this kind of information is essintial for design strategy
### Added features
* Reset test if the student leaves test page
* Downloading test result
### Extra ideas to achieve
* Use local storage to store some data and options (like autoNext option)
* Question timer
* Managing loading & error states
* Change the whole idea to (drag and drop) way
# At The End
